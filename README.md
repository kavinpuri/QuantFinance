# 📈 Unsupervised Learning Trading Strategy

This repository contains Python code for implementing an unsupervised learning trading strategy using machine learning techniques.

## 🚀 Overview

The trading strategy aims to:

🔍 **Analyze Data**: Group similar assets based on their features using K-Means clustering.
📊 **Portfolio Construction**: Select assets for each month based on the cluster and form a portfolio.
⚖️ **Optimization**: Optimize the portfolio using Efficient Frontier max sharpe ratio optimization.
📉 **Performance Evaluation**: Calculate daily portfolio returns and compare them to NIFTY500 returns.

## 🔑 Key Features

### Data Collection and Preprocessing

- **Web Scraping**: Data is scraped from Wikipedia to obtain the list of NIFTY500 stocks.
- **Yahoo Finance API**: Historical stock data is retrieved using Yahoo Finance API.
- **Calculations**: Various finance parameters such as Garman-Klass volatility, RSI, Bollinger Bands, ATR, MACD, and rupees volume are calculated.
- **Aggregation**: Data is aggregated to monthly level and the top 150 most liquid stocks are selected for each month.

### Clustering and Portfolio Optimization

- **K-Means Clustering**: Assets are grouped into clusters based on their features.
- **Portfolio Optimization**: Portfolio weights are optimized using Efficient Frontier max sharpe ratio optimization. If optimization fails, equal weights are applied.

### Performance Evaluation

- **Visualizations**: Portfolio returns are visualized and compared with NIFTY500 returns through time series plots, histograms, cumulative returns plots, and density plots.
- **Metrics**: The highest strategy return throughout the period is calculated for performance evaluation.

## 🛠️ Usage

1. Install the required libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Run the Python script `trading_strategy.py` to execute the trading strategy.
3. View the generated plots to analyze the performance of the trading strategy.
